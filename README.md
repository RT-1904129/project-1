# project-1
Here I try to create a machine learning model which can be used for any housing company to predict important feature required for investment in that house
here  use "house_perchase.csv"data to train my model.
I firstly do following process given as -:Exploratory data analysis(data cleaning,feature selection,remove outleir).
I mention every process in my jupiter note book code file in project-1.
Here i use "Advanced regression-Lasso and Ridge regression algorithim" to make my project.I work on two problem statement which I state below:
1)Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.
2)Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
you can see my code there i mention each step in jupiter notebook
