# Predict important feature required for investment in the house by housing 
Here I try to create a machine learning model which can be used by any housing company to predict important feature required for investment in that house . \
Here I use "house_perchase.csv" data to train my model. \
Firstly I did following process given as -: **Exploratory data analysis(data cleaning,feature selection,removing outleir).** \

In this Model I use **"Advanced regression-Lasso and Ridge regression algorithim"** .I work on two problem statement which I state below: \
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

I mention every process in my jupiter note book code file.\
